              Complete coach-client confidentiality meaning that all
              communications between you and the client including but not
              limited to messages, video sessions and assessment results remain
              private and confidential between coach and client and are not
              shared with ANY third party.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-5">
              Each new client on Skillsoft Coaching represents a complete
              engagement commitment unless terminated early by the client. We
              use the client maximum that you set in your profile as guidance
              for whether or not you are available for additional pairings. If
              at any time you&apos;d like to update that number, please do so
              via your profile keeping in mind the minimum requirement is 10
              clients.

            <li>
              Requirements for Skillsoft Coaching coaches may be amended from
              time to time, but currently include:
            </li>
            <ul className="mb-5 ml-7 list-disc">
              <li>Review of client&apos;s self and 360Â° assessments.</li>
              <li>Video sessions of either 30, 45 or 60 minutes.</li>
              <li>Review client&apos;s Coaching Plan.</li>
              <li>Messages and content sharing. </li>
              <li>Weekly minimum overall engagement. </li>
              <li>Response to client messages within 24 hours. </li>
            </ul>
            <li className="mb-5">
              You agree to complete non-disintermediation with both clients and
              their enterprise employers. This means you will not engage clients
              offline (via email, outside phone or VOIP calls, in-person
              meetings or other means), or attempt to solicit business with
              Skillsoft Coaching clients or their companies outside of the
              Skillsoft Coaching system. Our system alerts us to certain sharing
              formats (emails, phone numbers, etc.) and abuse of this will
              result in termination from the Skillsoft Coaching platform. From
              time-to-time a client may request an in-person meetup or to
              continue with their coach outside of the Skillsoft Coaching
              system, and we will make case-by-case decisions when brought to
              our attention. Please contact your Pluma Guide immediately if this
              type of situation arises.

              we can help.
