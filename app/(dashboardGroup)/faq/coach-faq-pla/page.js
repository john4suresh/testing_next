          Pluma&apos;s Pluma Leadership Assessment (PLA) was developed to gather
          information about three key areas for the client: (1) Developing
          Yourself (2) Developing the Business and (3) Leading Others.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-veryDark">
          Users self-assess with the PLA and can invite as many colleagues as
          they&apos;d like to assess them as well (we ask for a minimum of
          five). All of these results are visible to you under each
          client&apos;s assessment icon on the Dashboard.
