          <ul className="ml-6 list-disc">
            <li>
              <b>One action or topic per message:</b> Large messages look
              overwhelming so separate messages helps to keep things bite-size
              and digestible.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Limit follow-on messages:</b> Try to limit messages in a row to
              a maximum of four to six. Otherwise it begins to look like a wall
              of text.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Friendly and personal language:</b> To get across to the client
              that you care, make sure to include phrases like “I can understand
              that that is hard”, “I thought about the challenge with your
              coworker yesterday” – warmth that you would use in person goes a
              long way in messages as well.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Clear terms for engagement:</b> Clients should be aware of the
              coaching terms and format, but feel free to let them know what
              times of day you check your Dashboard so they know what to expect.
              “I usually check my Pluma messages once in the morning and once in
              the evening except on weekends where I only check in the
              afternoon.” As with your other coaching engagements, it’s always
              helpful to set and manage expectations clearly.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Grammar and punctuation are very important:</b> Incorrect use
              of punctuation and grammar send a strong signal of lack of
              professionalism and will damage trust. Be sure to capitalize the
              start of every sentence.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Spelling is key:</b> Modern browsers will automatically
              underline misspelled words in red. Be sure to fix all spelling
              mistakes before sending a message.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Engage with specifics:</b> When reaching out to a client or
              checking-in, say something specific like &quot;How did the meeting
              with XYZ go yesterday? Were you able to try the technique we
              discussed?&quot; This approach has a lot more value than vague
              check-ins like &quot;How are things going?&quot; or &quot;What
              would you like to discuss?&quot;
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Set deadlines:</b> Give clients specific homework or exercises
              related to the skills or goal they are working towards. Ask them
              to return the results to you by a specific date in order for you
              to review and discuss. This approach is key for increasing
              engagement and delivering results.
            </li>
            <li className="mt-4">
              <b>Avoid recommending paid services:</b> Do not ask clients to
              take outside paid assessments or sign up for paid subscription
              services for content or exercises. Book recommendations and the
              occasional article behind a paywall where they might have a number
              of free views are fine, but there should not be significant
              additional costs to being a client on the Pluma platform.
